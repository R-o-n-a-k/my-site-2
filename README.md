## 🚀 About Project

This project was my **second attempt** while learning **HTML** and **CSS**. I built this portfolio site as a foundational attempt to structure content, style components, and create responsive layouts. It demonstrates key front-end concepts such as **float**, **flexbox**, **image embedding**, **button navigation**, and **form creation**, all wrapped in a **minimal, clean UI**. This site helped me practice core web development skills and gave me a launchpad for future React projects.
